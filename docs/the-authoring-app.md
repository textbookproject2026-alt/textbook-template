# The authoring app

This guide is for you, the book's author. It covers the **Authoring Assistant** —
the small Mac app that tidies the links in your chapters, helps you build the
glossary, brings chapters in from Word, and shows you what other people have sent
in.

There is no terminal here and nothing to type. Installing it is dragging one icon
into your Applications folder, and after that the app shows you every change before
it makes one — nothing it does is hidden from you.

The guide has two halves, because the app has two:

- **Chapters** — the three questions it asks about a chapter you are working on.
- **Waiting for you** — reader suggestions, contributors' draft changes, and the
  one button that takes accepted work to readers.

---

## What it is, and where it comes from

**Authoring Assistant** is an ordinary Mac application, written for the textbooks
on this platform. It works on one book at a time, and the book you have open is
the only one it will touch (see *Which book* below). It isn't something you can
buy or download from an app store: the technical contact sends you a disk image,
and that's the only way you ever get it or update it.

- It runs **entirely on your own Mac**. The chapter analysis needs no internet at
  all.
- It is **signed and notarised by Apple**, so it opens like any other app — no
  "unidentified developer" warning, no right-click-to-open trick.
- It's built and signed by the platform, not by this book. Where it comes from,
  and how it's built, is in the platform's
  [`AUTHORING-APP-OPERATIONS.md`](https://github.com/textbookproject2026-alt/textbook-registry/blob/main/docs/AUTHORING-APP-OPERATIONS.md).

### Installing and opening it

1. Open the disk image you were sent.
2. Drag **Authoring Assistant** onto **Applications**.
3. Double-click it in Applications. Drag it to your Dock if you want it to hand.

**Your web browser opens, and that is where you use it.** Nothing else appears on
screen — no window of its own, no black terminal, no bouncing icon. Closing the
browser tab, or pressing **Quit** in the top corner, stops it.

Double-clicking the icon while it is already running brings the page back rather
than starting a second copy.

**To update it** you are sent a new disk image and drag it over the old one. There
is no *Check for updates*.

### Two habits worth having

**If you also edit a copy of the book in Obsidian, save and close the chapter
there first.** If a chapter is open in Obsidian with unsaved edits, those edits
are not on disk yet and the app cannot see them. Press **Command-S** and close the
tab before you start. The app watches for this: if a file changes on disk while
you are answering questions, it **refuses to save** and tells you to start again,
rather than overwriting what Obsidian wrote.

**There is no undo.** When you press save, the chapter is rewritten and the old
version is gone from your Mac. The app says so before you press, and you have to
tick a box. Every version is kept in the book's history, so nothing is ever truly
lost — but getting a version back is the technical contact's job, not a keystroke.

---

## Chapters: the three questions

Choose **Chapters**, then a single chapter, or your whole vault folder and pick a
chapter from the list. The app then asks you three kinds of question, one at a
time, with a counter at the top — *12 of 40*.

Every question shows you the sentence it found, with the proposed change
highlighted, and offers four answers:

- **Yes, make this change**
- **No, leave it alone**
- **Yes to every mention** of that term or citation
- **No to every mention** of it

At the end you are shown exactly what will change — the changed lines side by
side, and the whole chapter as it will be. You tick a box and press **Save these
changes**.

**It never reformats anything.** Only the exact lines being changed are rewritten.
Every other line is copied through character for character: no re-wrapping, no
tidied spacing, no reordering. Accept twelve changes across nine lines and exactly
nine lines change.

**Running it again is safe and quiet.** It skips citations already linked, concept
pages already linked, and terms already in the glossary — and tells you what it
skipped and why. A second run on the same chapter normally finds nothing to do.

### 1. Citations to the reference list

It finds citations in your running text — `(Smith, 1975)`, or `Smith (1975)` —
looks for a matching entry in **that chapter's own References section**, and offers
to turn the citation into a link that jumps straight down to the entry.

It only ever offers a citation when it has found the matching entry. A citation
with no entry is never invented and never guessed at: it is listed back to you at
the end as something to check, which is usually how you discover an entry missing
from your reference list.

### 2. Terms to concept pages

It finds places where a chapter mentions the title of one of your concept pages —
the short standalone pages in `chapters/Definitions/` — and offers to turn the
mention into a link to that page. Those links are what a reader sees pop up when
they hover a term.

It leaves alone anything in a heading, in a code block, in the reference list, or
already linked. It also reads a concept page's `aliases`, so a page can be found
under more than one wording.

If it says it found no concept pages, you almost certainly opened a single chapter
rather than the whole vault folder — it needs the vault to see the `Definitions`
folder.

### 3. Glossary terms

It looks for terms worth defining, using three ordinary signals:

- terms you introduce with a defining phrase — *"X is defined as"*, *"by X we
  mean"*, *"the term 'X'"*;
- terms you put in **bold** the first time you use them;
- capitalised terms of more than one word that come up more than once.

For each one it proposes the sentence that introduces it as the definition. Terms
already in the glossary are never offered again.

---

## `glossary.md` is written by the app

**This is the one thing in this guide to remember.** `glossary.md` at the top of
the book is not a hand-kept file. Every term you approve in the third question is
written into it by the app, and that is the normal way entries get there.

What it does, exactly:

- Each approved term becomes a `## Term` heading with its definition underneath,
  followed by *(First used in chapter-05.md.)*
- New entries are **spliced into alphabetical position** among the ones already
  there. Every existing line is copied through untouched.
- A term already in the file — matched on the heading, ignoring capitals — is
  never added twice and never rewritten. The app leaves your wording alone.
- You see the whole before-and-after of `glossary.md` on the confirmation screen,
  the same as for a chapter, before anything is written.

**So you can safely edit a definition by hand** — reword it, expand it, correct it
— and the app will not undo your edit. What is *not* safe is reorganising the file
in a way that stops it looking like a list of `##` headings in alphabetical order:
grouping terms under sections, renumbering them, or turning the headings into bold
text. Do that and new entries land in the wrong place, and terms the app thinks are
missing get added again underneath your renamed ones.

If you want the glossary structured differently, say so to the technical contact
rather than restructuring it yourself.

## Bringing in a Word chapter

The app also converts a Word document into a chapter in your vault: press **A Word
document** on the opening screen. It never changes or moves your Word file.

That is a guide in its own right, and it is
**[`docs/word-to-markdown.md`](word-to-markdown.md)** — how to write in Word so it
converts cleanly, what the app asks for and in what order, how to read its report,
what to do when something looks wrong, and how to get the finished chapter onto the
website. Read it there; it is not repeated here.

Two things worth knowing from this side:

- The chapter's pictures go into the book's own `assets/`, in a folder named
  after the chapter — the same convention as everything else in the book (see
  *How the book is organised* in `docs/editing-the-textbook.md`).
- A chapter fresh out of Word has no links in it at all, so the app offers to go
  straight through it with the same three questions. You can say "not now" and do
  it another day.

---

## Waiting for you

The second place in the app, beside **Chapters** at the top of the window, is
**Waiting for you**. It exists so that you never have to visit a website to deal
with what other people have sent in.

Everything in this half needs the internet. If you are offline it says so plainly,
and **nothing can be accepted, declined or published** until you are back.
Everything under Chapters keeps working as normal.

### Which book

Everything under **Waiting for you** belongs to **one book at a time**. The band
just under the title always says which book that is.

- **You choose the book, and your choice decides.** The app offers the books
  your GitHub account can make changes to, and **Change book** switches between
  them. You don't need a vault open: chapters can be changed in the book's
  drafts area.
- **A vault**, if you open one, can only be your copy of the chosen book.
  Opening a copy of a different book is refused, and choosing a different book
  closes the vault. That's what makes it impossible to put one book's
  suggestion into another book's chapter.
- **If the app refuses the vault**, with a message such as "This vault is a copy
  of …", the folder doesn't match the book the platform has on record. Nothing is
  written into it. Tell the technical contact the exact message.
- **"List of textbooks as of …"** in the band means the app couldn't fetch the
  current list and is using the last one it saw. It's usually harmless, and it
  clears itself when you're back online.

### Signing in, once

The first time, press **Sign in**. The app shows you a short code and opens a web
page; you type the code in and approve it. That is the whole of it, and you should
not have to do it again on this Mac.

You are signing in **as yourself**. Everything you accept or decline is recorded
under your own name, and the replies described below are posted under your name
too — not a robot's. You can withdraw the app's access at any time from your
GitHub account settings. Your sign-in is kept in this Mac's Keychain, not in a file
and never in your vault.

The sign-in identifier comes with the list of textbooks, so there's normally
nothing to set up. If the app shows a **One-off setup** card instead of a Sign in
button, it has never managed to fetch that list on this Mac. Check that you're
online and reopen it. If the card is still there, the technical contact can put
the identifier into Settings for you.

**When sign-in goes wrong**, every message you might see — the expired code, the
page that never opened, the unrecognised identifier, the refused Keychain prompt,
the list that stays empty — is triaged in
**[`docs/troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md)**, under *The author's console
won't sign in, or shows nothing waiting*. Go there rather than guessing; it lists
the exact wording of each message and says which ones are yours and which are the
technical contact's.

### Suggestions from readers

These come from the **Suggest an edit** button on the website. A reader describes
what they think is wrong; they need no account, so most come from ordinary readers.

Open one and you see who sent it, which page it is about, and what they said.
Then:

- **Accept** — you are taking it on. A thank-you is posted as a reply, the
  suggestion is marked as dealt with, and it disappears from the list.
- **Decline, politely** — a courteous reply is posted saying the text is staying
  as it is, and the suggestion is closed. This is a perfectly good outcome; an
  answered "no" is far better than silence.
- **Open in my browser** — for anything unusual.

**The replies are posted publicly, under your own name.** Both are written for
you — you do not compose them — and both end with a line saying they were sent
from the author's console, so a reader can see it was a considered reply rather
than a robot. Anyone can read them on the book's repository.

**"Accept" does not mean the app rewrites the chapter.** Most suggestions are
prose — *"this paragraph contradicts chapter 2"* — and no machine can carry that
out. The app says so plainly and leaves the change to you, under Chapters, with
the suggestion in front of you.

The one exception is a reader who writes an exact replacement — *"the the domains"
should be "the three domains"*. If that old wording appears in the chapter
**exactly once**, the app offers to make the change itself: it shows you the line
as it is and as it will be, you tick a box, and only that one line changes. If the
wording appears twice, or has gone already, it says so and leaves it to you rather
than guessing which one you meant.

For that to work it needs to know where your chapters are — there is a **Choose my
chapters folder** button at the bottom of the list.

### Draft changes

These are written by trusted contributors in the browser editor. **Nothing here
has reached readers**; contributors have no way to publish, and everything they
write waits for you.

Open one and you see, in plain before/after form, the wording they propose to
change. Then:

- **Accept this change** — it is folded into the drafts area, and put in line for
  the live book. It has still reached no reader.
- **Decline it** — it is closed.
- **Open in my browser** — offered automatically when a change is too big to read
  comfortably here, rather than printing a wall of text at you.

Deciding whether a change is right for the book is yours. Everything around that
decision is handled for you.

### Going live

Underneath the two lists is **Going live**: everything you have accepted, gathered
in one place, waiting to go to readers.

The drafts area is **shared** — anything written in the browser editor is in there
too — so what you see here is all of it together, whoever wrote it, and all of it
is what goes. Open it and you are shown how many changes there are, which pages
they touch and who wrote them. Tick the box and press **Publish to the live book**.

Four things are worth knowing.

**The app never publishes on its own.** Accepting puts a change in line and stops
there. Nothing reaches a reader until you press that button — because what would
go includes other people's work as well as the change you just accepted, and you
should see it before it goes.

**Sometimes it will not let you.** If the same wording has been changed both in
the drafts area and in the live book — usually because that line was also
changed on the live branch directly — it says so and refuses to choose between
them. Nothing is lost and
nothing is undone. It also tells you when it is simply still working out whether
the change can go, or waiting on the book's own checks, and says so in those words
rather than pretending everything is fine.

**The site takes a couple of minutes to catch up** (15 minutes at worst). It
rebuilds itself from the live branch; readers see the change once it has. If a
build fails, the previous version stays up and the change waits
(`docs/troubleshooting.md`).

**A copy in Obsidian will be behind afterwards.** If you keep one, going live
writes to the live book and your copy does not know about it. Your copy and the
live book now disagree, and the next thing you write in that file is where it
bites. **How your copy gets the latest** depends on how it reaches GitHub, which
is agreed with the technical contact and written down in
`docs/what-this-book-runs-on.md`. If it isn't written there, ask the technical
contact to bring your copy up to date after going live, rather than carrying on
and hoping.

### The weekly jobs

Underneath is a line for each of four weekly jobs — backing up reader comments,
and rebuilding the contributors, department editions and project health pages —
saying whether each last finished properly. The app looks for those four by name
in every book.

**A new book doesn't run them**, so the app can't find them and shows a
**Weekly jobs:** warning above the lists every time. That is a known fault in the
app, not a problem with your book, and it also hides the green "Nothing is
waiting" note. The two lists are still right; read them and ignore the warning.
If the book later adds those jobs, the line starts working on its own. If one
says it did not finish, tell the technical contact; the platform's
[`SCHEDULED-JOBS.md`](https://github.com/textbookproject2026-alt/textbook-registry/blob/main/docs/SCHEDULED-JOBS.md)
is the guide they'll use.

### Elsewhere

Two links out at the bottom, both read-only and both opening in your browser:
**Reader discussion**, every comment left in the margins of the book on one page,
and **History**, what changed, when and by whom, plus each year's published
edition.

---

## Settings

There is a **Settings** link in the top corner. There is nothing in it you have to
change, and it holds exactly two things.

**The sign-in identifier** for *Waiting for you*. It normally arrives with the
list of textbooks, and this box stays empty. It's only for the case above, where
the technical contact types one in by hand. It isn't a password or a secret.

**A DeepSeek key**, which is entirely optional. If you have an account with
DeepSeek — an AI service — you can paste your key here, and a tick box then appears
when you start a chapter: *Also ask DeepSeek for glossary suggestions*. Ticked, the
app sends **the text of that chapter** to DeepSeek and adds whatever extra glossary
terms it suggests to the ones the ordinary checks found. You approve or reject each
one exactly as before.

Three things about it:

- **It is off unless you set it up, and off unless you tick the box each time.**
  Nothing is ever sent to DeepSeek otherwise.
- **It is never required.** No key, no internet, a busy service, a nonsensical
  answer — every one of those falls back to the ordinary checks and says so on
  screen. Nothing stops.
- **It sends your chapter text to a company outside the university.** That is a
  decision worth taking deliberately rather than by ticking a box. If it has not
  been discussed, ask the technical contact and the maintainer before using it.

Both the key and your sign-in live in this Mac's Keychain — not in a file, and
never in your vault. The first time the app reads either after an update, macOS
may ask whether **Authoring Assistant** is allowed to use your Keychain. Say yes:
it is asking about its own saved items, nothing else on the Mac.

## When something goes wrong

| What you see | Where to go |
|---|---|
| Sign-in fails, or *Waiting for you* is empty when it shouldn't be | `docs/troubleshooting.md` — *The author's console won't sign in* |
| Anything about converting a Word document | `docs/word-to-markdown.md`, Part 4 |
| *This chapter changed on disk* | Something, usually Obsidian, saved the file underneath you. Nothing was written. Close the chapter in Obsidian and start again |
| The browser page didn't open | Double-click the app icon again |
| A citation wasn't offered | The matching entry is missing from that chapter's References section — the app lists these at the end |
| No concept pages were found | You opened a single chapter; open the whole vault folder instead |
| Nothing at all was found | You have already run it on that chapter. The final screen says what was skipped |

The app keeps a log at
`~/Library/Application Support/Authoring Assistant/log.txt`. You never need to read
it, but it is the first thing the technical contact will ask for.

**Nothing the app does is damage.** The site is always rebuilt from the
repository, and every past version of every file is kept.

---

## For the technical contact

Building, signing and releasing the app, its sign-in, how it learns about books,
and the DeepSeek egress path are the platform owner's, in
**[`textbook-registry/docs/AUTHORING-APP-OPERATIONS.md`](https://github.com/textbookproject2026-alt/textbook-registry/blob/main/docs/AUTHORING-APP-OPERATIONS.md)**.
The suggest-edit backend is in the platform's
[`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](https://github.com/textbookproject2026-alt/textbook-registry/blob/main/docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md) §2.
